### üìä Enhanced Comparison Framework

| Aspect | SmolVLM2 | SmolVLM | Moondream2 | LLaVA MLX | Phi-3.5-Vision |
|--------|----------|---------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Production Ready** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå Issues |
| **VQA Accuracy** | ü•á 66.0% | ü•à 64.0% | 56.0% | Variable | 60.0% |
| **Speed (Inference)** | 6.61s | 5.98s | üèÜ 4.06s | Moderate | 13.61s |
| **Memory Usage** | 2.08GB | 1.58GB | üèÜ 0.10GB | Moderate | 1.53GB |
| **Video Support** | ‚úÖ Native | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| **Apple Silicon** | ‚úÖ MLX | ‚úÖ MLX | ‚úÖ MPS | üèÜ Native MLX | ‚úÖ MLX |
| **Reliability** | ‚úÖ High | ‚úÖ High | ‚úÖ High | ‚úÖ Good | ‚ùå Critical Issues |

## üöÄ Prompt Engineering Strategy

### 1. Model-Specific Prompt Optimization
Based on current testing results, different models respond better to different prompt styles:

#### SmolVLM2 (Best Overall Performance)
- **Optimal Style**: Structured analysis requests
- **Example**: `"Analyze the activity in this image. What is the person doing, what tools are they using, and what might be their next step?"`

#### Moondream2 (Speed Champion)  
- **Optimal Style**: Direct, concise questions
- **Example**: `"What objects do you see and what task is being performed?"`

#### SmolVLM (Server-Based Reliability)
- **Optimal Style**: Context-aware instructions
- **Example**: `"I am your student. Look at this image of my workspace and guide me through the next step of the task."`

### 2. Role-Playing Prompts with Model Adaptation
- **Mentor-like**: Adapted based on model capabilities and response patterns
- **Safety Inspector**: Optimized for models with strong object detection (Moondream2)
- **Task Assistant**: Best suited for models with high accuracy (SmolVLM2)

```python
# Model-specific preprocessing in image_processing.py
def preprocess_for_model(image, model_type, config=None):
    """Preprocess image according to specific model requirements"""
    if 'smolvlm2' in model_type:
        return preprocess_for_smolvlm2(image, config)
    elif 'moondream2' in model_type:
        return preprocess_for_moondream2(image, config)
    elif 'llava_mlx' in model_type:
        return preprocess_for_llava_mlx(image, config)
    # ... other models
```

#### Configuration Management (Enhanced)
The configuration system now provides unified model path handling:

```python
# In config_manager.py - standardized model path access
def load_model_config(self, model_name):
    """Load model config with unified model_path support"""
    # Ensures model_path exists, converts model_id if needed
    if "model_id" in model_config and "model_path" not in model_config:
        model_config["model_path"] = model_config["model_id"]
```

### Performance Optimization Results

Based on comprehensive testing, key optimization findings:

1. **SmolVLM2**: Best accuracy/performance balance (66.0% VQA, 6.61s)
2. **Moondream2**: Optimal for speed-critical tasks (4.06s inference)
