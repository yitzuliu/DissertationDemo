# Implementation Summary - June 24, 2025

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Standard Model Interface Implementation
We have successfully implemented the standard model interface for all vision-language models in the system. This includes:

- Created implementation classes for each model type:
  - `Phi3VisionModel` for Microsoft's Phi-3 Vision model
  - `YOLO8Model` for YOLO8 object detection
  - `LLaVAModel` for LLaVA via Ollama
  - `SmolVLMModel` for SmolVLM with llama-server integration

- Each model implementation follows the `BaseVisionModel` abstract base class interface, providing consistent methods for:
  - Model loading and unloading
  - Image preprocessing
  - Prediction
  - Response formatting
  - Health checks and model information

- Created a factory class `VLMFactory` for easy model instantiation based on model type

- Added a basic test script (`test_model_interface.py`) to verify that all model interfaces work correctly

### 2. Image Preprocessing Pipeline

We've centralized and standardized image preprocessing across all models:

- Created a comprehensive image processing utility module (`image_processing.py`) with functions for:
  - Converting between different image formats (PIL, OpenCV/numpy, bytes)
  - Image enhancement using CLAHE
  - Model-specific image preprocessing
  - Image resizing with aspect ratio preservation

- Updated all model implementations to use the centralized image processing utilities

- Removed duplicate image preprocessing code from individual model implementations

## Next Steps

Based on the TODO list, our next priorities should be:

1. **Consistent Error Handling:** Implement a unified error handling strategy across all components.

2. **Backend Modularization:** Break down the monolithic backend into modular components with clear responsibilities.

3. **Model Context Memory:** Implement a system that maintains context between frames for more coherent responses.

We've made significant progress with the architecture standardization, having completed both the unified configuration system and the standard model interface tasks.
