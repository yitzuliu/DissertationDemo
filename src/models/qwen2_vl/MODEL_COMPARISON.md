## Real-world Scenario Performance Comparison

### Cooking Scene Example

**Input Image**: *Kitchen with chopped vegetables and seasonings*

**Qwen2-VL-2B Response**:
```
I see some chopped vegetables and several seasonings on the kitchen countertop. There are sliced carrots, onions, and some green vegetables, possibly bell peppers or celery. Next to them are several seasoning bottles that appear to be cooking spices.
```

**Qwen2.5-VL-3B Response**:
```
I see a carefully prepared set of vegetables arranged on a cutting board in the kitchen prep area. There are uniformly thin-sliced carrots, diced red onions, and finely chopped green cilantro. On the right are three seasoning bottles containing salt, black pepper, and red chili powder. From the prepared ingredients, this appears to be preliminary work for stir-frying or making a salad. The vegetables are cut neatly, indicating the cook has some culinary skills.
```

**MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2.5 Response**:
```
In the image, I observe a kitchen countertop with an organized arrangement of chopped vegetables and seasonings, indicating preparation for cooking. The ingredients include:

1. Carrots: Sliced into thin, even rounds, showcasing good knife skills.
2. Onions: Chopped into small, uniform pieces, releasing a pungent aroma.
3. Green bell peppers: Diced, adding a sweet and slightly tangy flavor.
4. Seasonings: Neatly lined up, including salt, black pepper, and paprika.

This setup suggests the cook is preparing to make a stir-fry or a similar dish, with all ingredients prepped for quick cooking.
```

**Phi-3-vision-4B Response**:
```
The image shows a cooking preparation scene with ingredients and seasonings on a kitchen countertop. Here's the breakdown:

- **Carrots**: Cut into thin, uniform slices, about 2-3mm thick, bright orange, with a glossy surface indicating freshness.
- **Onions (Red)**: Diced into small cubes, approximately 0.5cm, with a deep purple-red color.
- **Cilantro**: Finely chopped, bright green, with a mix of leaves and stems.
- **Seasonings**: Three glass bottles containing:
  1. Fine salt (white)
  2. Black pepper (dark granules)
  3. Chili powder (vivid red)

The ingredients are fresh, and the cutting skills are professional, suggesting the cook is experienced. This setup is typical for a stir-fry or salad, common in Asian or Mexican cuisines.
