# AI Models Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Date: June 24, 2025

We've completed a significant refactoring of the AI Manual Assistant's model code structure to improve organization and maintainability.

## Key Changes

1. **Directory Structure**: Moved each model implementation into its own subdirectory:
   - `/src/models/phi3_vision/`
   - `/src/models/LLava/`
   - `/src/models/smolvlm/`
   - `/src/models/yolo8/`

2. **Python Packages**: Created proper Python packages with `__init__.py` files in each model directory

3. **Import Updates**: Updated import paths in `base_model.py` to point to new locations:
   ```python
   from .phi3_vision.phi3_vision_model import Phi3VisionModel
   from .smolvlm.smolvlm_model import SmolVLMModel
   from .yolo8.yolo8_model import YOLO8Model
   from .LLava.llava_model import LLaVAModel
   ```

4. **Code Cleanup**: Removed old model files from the main models directory to avoid duplication

5. **Documentation**: Created a new README.md file explaining the refactored model structure

## Benefits

- **Better Organization**: Each model now has its own dedicated space for related files
- **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to locate and modify model-specific code
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Makes it easier to add new models in the future
- **Cleaner Imports**: More consistent import structure across the codebase

## Testing

The refactored code structure has been tested and all models can be properly imported. We created a test script that verifies:

1. Each model's files exist at the correct locations
2. The factory imports properly point to new locations
3. The import paths are valid and functional

## Next Steps

The refactoring is complete, but here are some recommended next steps:

1. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all project documentation reflects the new structure
2. **Integration Testing**: Run existing tests to ensure full compatibility with the new structure
3. **Deployment Testing**: Verify that the refactored structure works correctly when deployed

## Files Affected

- `/src/models/base_model.py` (updated imports)
- `/src/models/phi3_vision/phi3_vision_model.py` (moved)
- `/src/models/LLava/llava_model.py` (moved)
- `/src/models/smolvlm/smolvlm_model.py` (moved)
- `/src/models/yolo8/yolo8_model.py` (moved)
- `/src/models/README.md` (new file)
