Refactor model code into directory-based structure

- Move each model implementation into its own subdirectory
- Create proper Python packages with __init__.py files
- Update import paths in base_model.py
- Remove old model files from main directory
- Add README.md with new structure documentation
- Create test script to validate refactoring
